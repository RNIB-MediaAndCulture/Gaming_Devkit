# RNIB Devkit
As part of the Design For Every Gamer initiative RNIB have produced this devkit to help games developers make their games accessible for blind and partially sighted people. The Devkit can be read from here or downloaded and distributed.  We welcome comments, corrections and improvements. The games industry doesn't stand still and neither should this advice. You can get in touch at gaming@rnib.org.uk.   
## AKO Report Generator
The idea behind the AKORG is that at the begining of a project a games developer can check boxes to identify what type of game they are developing and a report is generated that: 
1. identifies potential accessibility pitfalls,
2. suggests things to consider to avoid them,
3. highlights accessibility design patterns that might help and
4. Gives some guidance on how to implement those patterns with common game engines.

The report is currently fairly sizable and requires many eyes to check over it and fix any errors. All input is welcome.
