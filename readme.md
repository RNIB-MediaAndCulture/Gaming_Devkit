# RNIB Devkit
As part of the Design For Every Gamer initiative RNIB have produced this devkit to help games developers make their games accessible for blind and partially sighted people. The Devkit can be read from here or downloaded and distributed.  We welcome comments, corrections and improvements. The games industry doesn't stand still and neither should this advice. You can get in touch at gaming@rnib.org.uk.
