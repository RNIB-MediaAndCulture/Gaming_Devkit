    - name: "Card battlers and Deck building games
      description: >
        Card battlers and deck building games are digital versions of card games. Each card is a gameplay modifier, and these are used competitively against other players to score points and win rounds. These may use a communal deck of cards but commonly players build up their personal deck through random gifts, purchases using in game currency, points scored, accumulating a set number of tokens or players may even be able to capture them from opponents. The positions the cards can be played in may also have modifier functions and the player may need to know what cards their opponent has played and where.
