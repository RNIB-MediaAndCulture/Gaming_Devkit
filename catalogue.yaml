  mechanics:
    - name: "Perceive direction"
      description: >
      In a virtual world the user needs to be able to navigate to a particular direction. This could be because 
      they need to 'go north' or because they are being told that a quest item is in that direction. 
      This is separate to knowing which 'path' to take.
      potential barriers:
      - barrier: Direction is communicated visually and is not accessible to people with sightloss
        - Consider providing a ping only when the user is facing the direction to be perceived.
        - Consider enabling the player to set a steady sonar ping in the direction that needs to be perceived.

    - name: "Adjustable semantic audio profiles"
      description: >
        By separating audio into profiles such as dialogue, music, sound effects (conveying meaning) and background 
        (providing atmosphere) these can then have their volumes independently adjustable. This enables a player to 
        increase the volume of audio that helps them while reducing the volume of other audio.
