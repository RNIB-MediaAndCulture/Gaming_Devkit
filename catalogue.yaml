    This document Aims to encompass the types of games that exist in order to identify accessibility barriers 
    and offer suggested solutions. It is broadly inspired by object based programming where something can 
    'inherit' properties from parents. In this way it offers 'aspects of experience' which will embody aspects 
    of a game. A first person shooter game will inherit the Combat (first person) aspect but may also inherit the 
    Exploration and Team communication aspects.  
    The document then lists relevant mechanics for each aspect of experience. These are actions you might expect 
    to perform as part of this aspect or ways in which you might expect to interact with it. These describe 
    potential accessibility barriers and ways in which you might overcome those barriers. The suggestions of ways 
    to overcome the barriers may point to accessibility design patterns.

      description: >
        By separating audio into profiles such as dialogue, music, sound effects (conveying meaning) and background 
        (providing atmosphere) these can then have their volumes independently adjustable. This enables a player to 
        increase the volume of audio that helps them while reducing the volume of other audio. 
        See also Clean audio.
        
    - name: "Audio beacons"
      description: >
        Audio beacons are sounds 'placed around' the user using immersive audio. They can act as a way to locate 
        objects in a virtual space, to annotate objects or to provide waypoints for navigation.

    - name: "Audio description"
      description: >
        Audio description or AD is a spoken soundtrack that describes visual information people with sight loss would
        otherwise miss. They are typically available of pre-recorded immutable content.

    - name: "Binaural audio"
      description: >
        Binaural audio usually refers to replicating the way surround sound is encoded by our ears. This enables 
        surround sound to be delivered via headphones in a way that our brain can recreate the soundscape around us. 

    - name: "Captions"
      description: >
        Captions are lines of text within a users view that correspond to audio information. They can translate 
        between languages, provide a real-time transcript of speech for people who would struggle to hear or 
        understand spoken language or describe sounds for people with hearing loss. They may also encourage language 
        learning or reduce cognitive load by providing multi-channel communication. 

    - name: "Clean audio"
      description: >
        Dialogue and sound effects conveying information can have their volume boosted compared to other audio. 
        This could be a single toggle or a set of profiles (with non-information conveying audio being full, 
        reduced or muted). See also [Adjustable semantic audio profiles](#adjustable-semantic-audio-profiles).

    - name: "Clear fonts and text"
      description: >
        Avoid block capitals as these obscure the shape of words. Ensure easy to read fonts are available and are 
        preferably the default.  

    - name: "Coded audio"
      description: >
        By designing sound effects for similar actions to have similar characteristics it is possible to 
        communicate actions that are happening through sound. This was done in Killer Instinct where a blind 
        player could tell whether an attack was high or low (for example) by the sound effect associated with 
        it. It is also used in God of War Ragnarok where there are sound effects for an unblockable or 
        undodgeable attacks.

    - name: "CVD friendly communication"
      description: >
        Colour Vision Deficiency (Colour Blindness) is a relatively common disability where people have trouble 
        distinguishing different colours. Information should not be communicated using colour alone but should 
        also use shape and pattern. CVD filters and can help but care should be taken not to create unnatural 
        colours (trees should be displayed as green but the uniforms of enemy soldiers in the trees should be 
        affected by the filter or be preselectable from a range of options or profiles). CVD is a spectrum so 
        unless a colour profile is tailored to a player it could make colours seem unnatural and break immersion.

    - name: "Customisable UI / HUD"
      description: >
        Elements such as crosshairs and cursors should be customisable so they can be made large enough and high 
        contrast enough for partially sighted gamers but not too large for other gamers. Size, shape and colour 
        can all make a difference.

    - name: "Digital control"
      description: >
        Digital control is where any input can be performed with discrete button presses or actions. Analogue input 
        such as analogue joysticks or holding down keys to move a curser can make it hard for blind and partially 
        sighted people to follow where they are in an interface.

    - name: "High Contrast"
      description: >
        Parts of a visual are made to 'stand out' by using contrasting colours. This is often used for text but 
        could also be used for symbols, the outlines of objects etc. WCAG contains a formula for determining the 
        contrast ratio between two colours.

    - name: "Magnification"
      description: >
        Part or all of the visuals are enlarged making them easier to see. 

    - name: "Mono audio"
      description: >
        People who have hearing loss in one ear can benefit from stereo audio being flattened to mono audio so 
        that no audio information is going just to the ear with hearing loss. 

    - name: "Opaque background"
      description: >
        Transparent backgrounds behind text or icons can make them hard to read/perceive for partially sighted 
        people. Having an option to set opaque backgrounds (preferably as a default) can improve readability. 

    - name: "Pre-recorded audio clips"
      description: >
        Instead of using text-to-speech for audio access to immutable text such as menu options pre-recorded audio 
        can be nicer to listen to and give a better user experience.

    - name: "Resizable text"
      description: >
        Make sure that any text the player needs to read can be resized. Many partially sighted people benefit from 
        larger text and some people with extreme loss of peripheral vision may benefit from smaller text.

    - name: "Resizable UI"
      description: >
        Onscreen interfaces can be made bigger to be easier to read and understand or smaller so they obscure less 
        of the screen.

    - name: "Screenreader support"
      description: >
        Many platforms (especially Android, iOS and PC) contain screenreaders. A screenreader is a piece of software 
        that parses metadata available in software and apps to provide verbal access to visual information. Enabling 
        a screenreader to provide accessibility for your game can be as easy as adding metadata to UI elements but 
        refer to documentation from platform providers to find out what you would need to do.

    - name: "Visual safe zone"
      description: >
        Players with a loss of peripheral vision may not be aware of important information placed around the edges 
        of the screen. They will likely know where to look for persistent UI elements but may miss temporarily 
        available information or information changes around the borders. A visual safe zone is the area from the 
        centre of the screen up to a virtual border where information the player may need to know should be placed. 

    - name: "Visual sound effects"
      description: >
        In a virtual space objects that make sounds can have captions or speech bubbles placed on them to make them 
        accessible for people with hearing loss.
